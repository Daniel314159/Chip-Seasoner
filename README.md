# Chip-Seasoner
This a chip seasoner control system. Use at your own risk.
It uses three sensors an HC-SR04 to measure distance. This is to be aimed at a conveyor and measures turns on the shaker if it dedects a shorter distance than the distance to the conveyor. The other two sensors are FC-51 IR sensors. The one sensor dedects the rotation of the conveyor shaft and returns the RPM. The second sensor returns the presense or absence of falling seasonings in the hopper.
If the the distance is under the set distance and the conveyor is turning the relay trips activating the seasoner.
